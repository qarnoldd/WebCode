            <p>The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme, established by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act), is a single national framework for reporting and disseminating company information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy production, energy consumption and other information specified under NGER legislation.</p>
            <p>The objectives of the NGER scheme are to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>inform government policy</li>
                <li>inform the Australian public</li>
                <li>help meet Australia's international reporting obligations</li>
                <li>assist Commonwealth, state and territory government programmes and activities, and</li>
                <li>avoid duplication of similar reporting requirements in the states and territories.</li>
            </ol>
