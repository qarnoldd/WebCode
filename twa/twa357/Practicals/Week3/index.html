                    <p>February 18, 2023</p>
                    <p>There's a droll analogy kicking around (what's left of) the climate Twittersphere about<a href="https://twitter.com/Constababble/status/1621345346063577090" target="_blank" class="extsite"> carbon pollution offsets</a> that goes a little like this: What if I were to punch you in the face, but given Kyle over there is also planning to punch you in the face later on, I'll pay him not to? Would one offset the injury of the other? And how would you feel if you later discovered that Kyle never planned to punch you in the face in the first place?</p>

                    <p>The tweet is resonating because its points are well-made, and because criticism is piling up on the government's carbon offset plans, which are at the heart of its so-called safeguards mechanism, which is at the heart of its mechanism for cutting domestic greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                    <p>Complicated? Well, to understand the criticism, and the analogy, you need to understand the policy.</p>

                    <h3>The Safeguard Mechanism</h3>
                    Under the <a href="https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/NGER/The-safeguard-mechanism" target="_blank" class="extsite">safeguards mechanism</a>, the 215 biggest-emitting facilities in the country will have a collective cap of 143 million tonnes placed on how much greenhouse gas they can freely dump into the atmosphere. On July 1 this year, the government will cut that cap by 7 million tonnes, to allow them to collectively emit 136 million for free. Each year until 2030 the cap falls by another 7 million tonnes.

                    <p id="captionvid"><strong>Warning:</strong> This video contains strong language that may offend. Viewer discretion advised.</p>
                    <iframe id="vid" width = "560" height = "315" src ="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrkE_VaMD4k" title="The Juice Media. The safeguard mechanism honest government ad"></iframe>

                    <p>To provide carrot and stick, the companies owning those facilities that don't meet their targets will be compelled to buy either safeguard mechanism credits from those that do, or "Australian carbon credit units" (ACCUs). Each ACCU represents a tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that has been stored or avoided in an accredited project.</p>

                    <p>Initially, the price of a safeguard mechanism credit will be capped at $75, but that will increase annually by CPI plus 2 per cent, so they could be trading for $100 each by 2030. This means, according to energy economist Tim Buckley, whose sums I have shamelessly stolen for this, that by 2030 the companies that own the polluting facilities can either invest in new clean technologies or processes, or cop a collective $4.9 billion annual hit. And that will double again to $9 billion by 2035.</p>

                    <p>Buckley reckons this painful ratchet will be enough incentive to drive many to clean up their act. Because many polluting companies will choose to electrify their industrial processes, the policy works hand in glove with the government's goal to increase the share of renewables in the electricity grid to 82 per cent by 2030.</p>

                    <p>The problem, say critics like ANU environmental law professor Andrew Macintosh, is that some of those ACCUs might be dirty in the first place.</p>

                    <p>The main methods for creating ACCUs are in establishing projects that harvest gas emanating from landfill waste, avoid deforestation and regenerate cleared land. But what if landholders are being paid to regenerate desert land that would never sustain carbon-rich forests, or to not clear land that would never have been cleared in the first place? Or in our analogy above, what if Kyle never planned to take a swing?</p>

                    <p>According to Macintosh, that happened at scale under the old guidelines. He and his colleagues have, for example, mapped regeneration projects and shown that they lie almost entirely in what could most generously be described as marginal land. Or in more blunt terms, in the desert.</p>

                    <p>"The problem is that no one goes out and checks the projects. The credits are issued based on a model and the model is being grossly misapplied," he says.</p>

                    <p>"On average these [regeneration] projects might be able to increase the mass of trees by 5 per cent, but they are being credited for a 100 per cent increase. It is nothing short of fraud."</p>

                    <h3>Independent review of the integrity of Australian Carbon Credit Units</h3>
                    <p>In a paper published this week by Macintosh and his colleagues, they estimate 70 per cent of credits already issued are "high risk". They remain unconvinced by a recent <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction/independent-review-accus" target="_blank" class="extsite">independent review</a> led by Professor Ian Chubb that found the system to be "essentially sound", but recommended improving its integrity.</p>

                    <p>Other critics note that even if the projects were sound, avoiding emissions is not as certain a benefit to the planet as not emitting them in the first place. Even a forest that does regenerate, storing millions of tonnes of carbon for tens of years, can burn down on a hot afternoon, dumping all that carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>The ABC's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-13/carbon-colonialism/101968870" target="_blank" class="extsite">Four Corners program</a> on Monday focused on forests in Papua New Guinea ostensibly protected by another offset program that were being logged by local landholders with little understanding of contracts they were said to have been party to.</p>

                    <p>The Greens' criticism of the policy is more fundamental even than this. Leader Adam Bandt is offering to back the legislation needed to bed down the scheme if the government agrees to ban investment in all new coal and gas projects.</p>

                    <p>In doing so, Bandt is seeking to underscore the point that while the plan might reduce onshore emissions by 200-odd million tonnes, it does nothing about the billions of tonnes caused by Australian fossil fuels exports.</p>

                    <p>Nonetheless, Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen is betting the Greens and other progressive voices in the Senate will not want to be seen to be opposing a policy that would significantly reduce onshore emissions.</p>

                    <p>So far, despite reservations about offsets, many climate observers have given Bowen the benefit of the doubt. But if the mechanism does not work to drive down emissions as soon as next year, Bandt's calls to curb a vast, vital and increasingly unpopular industry will begin to resonate louder, further complicating the government's climate plans.</p>

                    <p>Which brings to mind that old line of Mike Tyson's: Everybody's got a plan until they get a punch in the mouth.</p>
